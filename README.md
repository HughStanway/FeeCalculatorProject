# FeeCalculatorProject

Simple Python program to calculate the profit received after shipping costs and selling fee for common online marketplaces, such as Depop and Ebay. The program contains a simple user interface made using pythons Tkinter library. One of the first programs that I made so therefore the source code is very simple.
